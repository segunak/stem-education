  After adding a new page, you’ll see our **WYSIWYG editor** in this panel. It
  lets you type and format text just like you would in a word processor, with
  buttons for:


  * **Bold** and *Italic* text

  * **Strikethrough**

  * **Blockquotes**

  * **Inline Code** or code blocks

  * **Images**

  * **Numbered** and **bulleted** lists


  You can also **copy and paste** from other documents, and the editor will
  preserve most basic formatting. Feel free to highlight key concepts, embed
  code snippets, or insert screenshots and diagrams for extra clarity.


  Because we’re in **Beta**, we appreciate any feedback on your editing
  experience—just click **“Give Feedback”** or join our Community discussions to
  let us know what’s working well or could be improved!
