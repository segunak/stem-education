# User Story: Robot Dog Exercise Routine

## Overview

As students in the robotics workshop, you will create a detailed exercise routine for the robot dog to keep it in shape. This routine will consist of a series of exercises, including both simple and complex movements. Your task is to implement this routine, ensuring the robot dog maintains balance and performs each exercise correctly.

## Objective

Create an exercise routine for the robot dog that lasts a minimum of 2 minutes. The routine should include various exercises such as sitting, standing, stretching, flips, handstands, push-ups, jumps, and walking. Additionally, the robot dog should play a melody at the end of the routine.

## Background

In a software development team, multiple roles work together to build and deliver software products. Each member of the team has a specific role, but they all need to collaborate closely to achieve the common goal. Here are some common roles in a software development team:

- **Product Owner:** Responsible for defining the product vision and managing the product backlog.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the teamâ€™s work and ensures that Agile practices are followed.
- **Developers:** Write the code to implement the features and fix bugs.
- **Testers:** Ensure the quality of the product by testing it thoroughly.
- **Designers:** Create the user interface and experience.

For this exercise, you will be working in groups, with each member taking on a specific role. Here are the roles and their responsibilities:

- **Lead Developer:** Writes the main code for the routine.
- **Assistant Developer:** Helps the lead programmer and writes supplementary code.
- **Tester:** Continuously runs the program to check for errors and ensure it meets the requirements.
- **Documenter:** Keeps track of what has been done, writes comments in the code, and ensures everyone understands the progress.
- **Project Manager:** Ensures the team is on track, keeps everyone organized, and makes sure all tasks are completed on time.

## Key Concepts

- **Commands:** Specific instructions that tell the robot dog what to do. Each command corresponds to a different movement or action.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the exercise routine, you need to prepare the robot dog by following these steps in your code:

1. **Connect the Ports:** Use the `autoConnect()` function to establish a connection between the computer and the robot dog. This ensures that you can send commands to the robot dog.

2. **Deactivate the Voice Module:** This will ensure the robot dog does not respond to voice commands during the exercise. Use the command `sendSkillStr("XAd 0", 1)`.

## Function to Use

You will primarily use the `sendSkillStr()` function to implement the exercise routine. Here is the function definition:

```python
def sendSkillStr(skillStr, delayTime):
    """
    Send a skill command to the robot dog.

    Parameters:
    skillStr (str): The command string for the skill.
    delayTime (int): The time to wait in seconds after the skill is performed.
    """
```

## Exercise Routine

Your task is to create a program that makes the robot dog perform the following exercises in sequence. Implement each item using the `sendSkillStr()` function and the respective command name. The program should be written in Python, not coding blocks.

1. **Sit Down:** The robot dog should sit down. Use the command `ksit` and wait for 1 second.
2. **Stand Up:** The robot dog should stand up. Use the command `kup` and wait for 1 second.
3. **Stretch:** The robot dog should stretch. Use the command `kstr` and wait for 1 second.
4. **Front Flip:** The robot dog should perform a front flip. Use the command `kff` and wait for 1 second.
5. **Back Flip:** The robot dog should perform a back flip. Use the command `kbf` and wait for 1 second.
6. **Handstand:** The robot dog should perform a handstand. Use the command `khds` and wait for 1 second.
7. **Continuous Jumping:** The robot dog should perform 5 consecutive executions of the jump action. Use the command `kjmp` and wait for .5 seconds between each jump.
8. **Continuous Push-Ups:** The robot dog should perform 5 executions of the push up action. Use the command `kpu` and wait for .5 seconds per iteration.
9. **Continuous Boxing:** The robot dog should perform 10 executions of the boxing action. Use the command `kbx` and wait for .3 seconds per iteration.
10. **Continuous Front Flips:** The robot dog should perform 3 continuous front flips waiting for 3 seconds after each. Use the command `kff`.
11. **Continuous Back Flips:** The robot dog should perform 3 continuous back flips waiting for 3 seconds after each. Use the command `kbf`.
12. **Pee:** The robot dog should perform the pee action. All that working out will have it ready to go. Use the command `kpee` and wait for 1 second.
13. **Play Dead:** The robot dog should play dead. Use the command `kpd` and wait for 1 second.
14. **Rest:** The robot dog should rest. Use the command `krest` and wait for 1 second.
15. **Play Melodies:** The robot dog should play the 3 melodies provided in the starter code for this user story. After playing a melody, the program should wait 5 seconds before playing the next one. You need only call the functions for each of the melodies, named `playMelody1()`, `playMelody2()`, and `playMelody3()`. After playing the melodies, try and guess what popular folks/cultural songs each is!
