# The sendSkillStr function sends a command to the robot dog to perform a skill.
# It takes two parameters:
# - The first parameter is the skill string (e.g., 'ksit') which tells the robot what to do.
# - The second parameter is the delay time in seconds (e.g., 3) which determines how long the robot will wait after performing the action.

# Write your code below! The first command has been written for you.
