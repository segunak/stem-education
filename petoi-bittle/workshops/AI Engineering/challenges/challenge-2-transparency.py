CHALLENGE 2: Responsible AI Transparency
========================================

üéØ MISSION: Make the AI show what commands it's actually sending to the robot.
This is called "AI transparency" - a crucial responsible AI practice.

üìñ WHY THIS MATTERS:
When AI controls physical devices (robots, cars, medical equipment), we need to see 
what it's doing! This builds trust and helps debug problems.

üîß YOUR TASK:
1. Run this file - notice you can't see what commands the AI sends
2. Change SHOW_COMMANDS from False to True below
3. Run again - now you can see every command the AI sends!
4. Try various commands and watch the transparency in action

üí° WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
- How to make AI systems transparent
- Why this is important for safety
- How to debug AI behavior
- Responsible AI engineering practices
