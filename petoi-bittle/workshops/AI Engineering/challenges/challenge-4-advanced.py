CHALLENGE 4: Full API Connection (ADVANCED)
===========================================

üéØ MISSION: Connect AI to live robot documentation from the internet!
This is called "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG).

üîß STEP BY STEP:
1. Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (play button, upper right corner) - AI knows limited commands from previous challenges
2. Look for the setting below that controls API access
3. Figure out how to enable it (hint: it's currently disabled)
4. Copy the example code in fetch_api_documentation() and uncomment it
5. Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è - now AI knows EVERYTHING about the robot!
6. Check robot-dog-commands.md for more advanced commands to try

üí° RAG: Instead of pre-programming knowledge, AI fetches it live from URLs
üí° COPY & PASTE: The example code is provided - just copy and uncomment it!

üí° TO EXIT: Type "quit" or "exit" in the chat, then click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to run again

RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY - Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button (upper right corner)!

    üéØ YOUR IMPLEMENTATION WORKSPACE
    
    This function should fetch the robot API documentation from the internet.
    This is called "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG) - getting fresh data for AI!
    
    üí° STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:
    
    1. Use try/except to handle errors safely
    2. Inside try: use urllib.request.urlopen(API_URL) to open the URL
    3. Use .read() to get the data, then .decode('utf-8') to make it text
    4. Return the text
    5. In except: print error message and return None
    
    üí° EXAMPLE PATTERN:
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(API_URL) as response:
            return response.read().decode('utf-8')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching API: {e}")
        return None
    
    Returns:
        str: The API documentation text, or None if failed
