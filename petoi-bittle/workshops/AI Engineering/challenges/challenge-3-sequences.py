CHALLENGE 3: Command Sequences
==============================

üéØ MISSION: Teach the AI to do multiple actions in a row!
Instead of single commands, create sequences like "dance" or "morning routine".

üìñ HOW SEQUENCES WORK:
Normal commands send one robot code. Sequences send multiple codes in order.
This lets you create complex behaviors from simple building blocks!

üîß YOUR TASK:
1. Enable sequences by changing ENABLE_SEQUENCES to True
2. Add sequence commands to ROBOT_COMMANDS (see examples below)
3. Test your sequences - try asking the AI to "dance"!
4. Create your own creative sequences

üí° SEQUENCE FORMAT:
Instead of {"command": "code"}, use {"sequence": ["code1", "code2", "code3"]}

üí° IDEAS FOR SEQUENCES:
- "dance": combination of jumps, spins, and poses
- "morning routine": stretch, stand up, wave
- "show off": backflip, jump, wave, bow
- "patrol": walk forward, spin, walk back
