CHALLENGE 3: Command Sequences
==============================

üéØ MISSION: Teach the AI to do multiple actions in a row!

üîß STEP BY STEP:
1. Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (play button, upper right corner) - try asking for "dance" (won't work yet)
2. Look for the setting that controls sequences  
3. Figure out how to enable it (hint: it's currently disabled), do so, then stop the program
4. Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è again - now try "dance" or "morning routine"!
5. Add your own sequences by copying the examples in MY_CUSTOM_SEQUENCES
6. Check robot-dog-commands.md for sequence examples and robot codes

üí° SEQUENCES: Chain multiple robot codes together for complex behaviors
üí° EASY FORMAT: Just copy the examples in MY_CUSTOM_SEQUENCES and modify!

üí° TO EXIT: Type "quit" or "exit" in the chat, then click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to run again

RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY - Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button (upper right corner)!
