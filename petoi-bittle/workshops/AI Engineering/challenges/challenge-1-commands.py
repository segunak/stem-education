CHALLENGE 1: Teaching AI New Commands
=====================================

üéØ MISSION: The robot knows 50+ commands, but your AI only knows 3!
Your job is to teach it more by adding commands to the dictionary below.

üìñ HOW THIS WORKS:
The AI gets "context" from the ROBOT_COMMANDS dictionary. More commands = smarter AI!
This is called "context engineering" - a key AI skill.

üîß YOUR TASK:
1. Run this file first - try asking the AI to "jump" (it won't work!)
2. Look at robot-dog-commands.md for available commands
3. Add "jump" and other commands to ROBOT_COMMANDS below
4. Save and run again - now "jump" should work!

üí° HINTS:
- Each command needs: "name": {"command": "code", "description": "what it does"}
- Copy examples from robot-dog-commands.md
- Ask GitHub Copilot: "Add robot commands to this dictionary"
- Add at least 10 commands to see the AI get much smarter!

üöÄ WELCOME TO THE AI ROBOT WORKSHOP!
This is Challenge 1 of 4. Complete them in order for the best experience.
