"""
AI Robot Controller - Context Engineering Workshop
====================================================

This program shows how AI becomes powerful through CONTEXT.

What you'll learn:
‚Ä¢ AI only knows what we teach it
‚Ä¢ By adding    # Clean shutdown
    print("\nüîÑ Shutting down safely...")
    try:
        closePort()  # Close connection
        print("‚úÖ Done!")
    except:
        print("‚úÖ Done!")s to ROBOT_COMMANDS, you make AI smarter
‚Ä¢ This is called "AI Engineering" - connecting AI to real systems

Your Challenge:
‚Ä¢ The robot can do 50+ tricks
‚Ä¢ This AI only knows 3 basic commands  
‚Ä¢ Teach the AI more by adding commands to ROBOT_COMMANDS below

How to use:
1. Run this program
2. Try: "stand up", "sit down", "jump"
3. Add new commands and restart to test them
4. Check serial-protocol.md for all available robot commands
