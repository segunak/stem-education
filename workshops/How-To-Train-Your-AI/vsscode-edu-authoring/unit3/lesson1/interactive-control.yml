  # Interactive Text Generation


  **Your Task:** Take full control of your AI by adjusting all parameters and
  choosing a starting word.


  ## Full Control Parameters:

  - **Output Length**: How many words to generate

  - **Window Size**: How much context to use

  - **Temperature**: How creative vs. predictable the text will be

  - **Starting Word**: The first word to begin your text


  ## Experiment Tasks:

  1. Try the default settings first

  2. Then use `window_size=6`, `temperature=0.7` for better coherence

  3. Try different starting words like "The", "I", or "On" to see how they
  affect the theme


  ## Challenge:

  Can you find the perfect combination to create the most human-like text?
