      # Step 2: Adding Context and Temperature

      Now let's improve our text generator by adding two key concepts:

      ## Context Window (Markov Chain)

      A **context window** (or window size) determines how many previous words the AI considers when choosing the next word. For example:

      - `window_size=1`: Looks at just the last word to predict the next one
      - `window_size=3`: Looks at the last three words to predict the next one

      Larger window sizes typically produce more coherent text because they capture more context.

      ## Temperature

      **Temperature** controls how "predictable" vs. "creative" the AI is when selecting words:

      - **Lower temperature** (e.g., 0.3): More predictable, consistent text
      - **Higher temperature** (e.g., 1.5): More varied, surprising, sometimes nonsensical text

      ## Instructions

      1. Run `02_markov_improved.py`
      2. First try the default settings
      3. Then experiment with different settings:
         - Try `window_size=3` and `temperature=0.5` for more coherent text
         - Try `window_size=6` and `temperature=0.7` for even better results
         - Experiment with different combinations to see how they affect the output

      **Compare the results to the random output from Step 1. Do you notice improved coherence?**
