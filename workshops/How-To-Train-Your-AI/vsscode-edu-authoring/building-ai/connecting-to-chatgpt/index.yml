      # Connecting to ChatGPT

      Congratulations! You've built and trained your own simple text generator. You've experienced firsthand the core principles that make AI work:

      1. **Context matters**: Looking at previous words helps predict the next one
      2. **Temperature controls creativity**: Balancing predictability and surprise
      3. **Parameters affect output**: Tweaking settings changes results
      
      ## From Your Model to ChatGPT

      ChatGPT works on the same fundamental principles but with massive scaling:

      | Your Model | ChatGPT |
      |------------|---------|
      | Small training dataset | Trained on billions of examples |
      | Simple Markov chain | Complex transformer architecture |
      | Window size of 3-6 words | Context window of thousands of tokens |
      | Basic word selection | Advanced pattern recognition across languages |
      | Runs on your computer | Requires massive data centers |
      
      ## Key Takeaways

      - AI isn't magic—it's pattern recognition at scale
      - The core "guess, check, adjust" cycle is universal
      - AI doesn't truly "understand"—it predicts based on patterns
      - More data, more compute power, and more parameters = better results
      
      **Now you understand the core concepts behind how ChatGPT and other large language models work!**
