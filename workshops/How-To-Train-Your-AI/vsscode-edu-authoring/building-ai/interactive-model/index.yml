      # Step 3: Interactive Text Generation

      Now let's take full control of our AI text generator! In this step, you'll:
      
      1. Choose the output length
      2. Select the window size (context)
      3. Set the temperature (creativity vs. predictability)
      4. Provide a starting word to guide the generation

      ## Instructions

      1. Run `03_interactive.py`
      2. Try different combinations of parameters:
         - **Output length**: How many words to generate (try 30-50)
         - **Window size**: How many previous words to consider (try 5-6)
         - **Temperature**: How creative the AI is (try 0.7 for balance)
         - **Starting word**: Any word from the training data (try "The", "I", or "On")
      
      ## What to Notice

      Observe how each parameter affects the style and coherence of the generated text:
      
      - Larger window sizes generally produce more coherent text
      - Lower temperatures create more predictable output
      - Different starting words lead to different themes
      
      **Experiment until you find settings that produce the most interesting or coherent text!**
