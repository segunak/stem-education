  # What is a Markov Chain?
  
  A Markov chain is a mathematical system that moves from one "state" to another based on probabilities. For text generation, these "states" are words or sequences of words.
  
  ## How Markov Chains Work for Text
  
  Imagine we have the sentence: "The cat sat on the mat"
  
  If we want to predict what comes after "The cat", we look at our training data to find all occurrences of "The cat" and see what words followed it. Maybe we find:
  - "The cat sat..." (appears 3 times)
  - "The cat jumped..." (appears 1 time)
  
  Using this information, if we see "The cat" again, we'd predict "sat" with 75% probability and "jumped" with 25% probability.
  
  ## Window Size: How Much Context to Consider
  
  A key parameter in Markov chains is "window size" - how many previous words we use for context:
  
  - **Window Size = 1**: Only look at the last word (e.g., after "cat", what comes next?)
  - **Window Size = 2**: Look at the last two words (e.g., after "The cat", what comes next?)
  - **Window Size = 3**: Look at the last three words (e.g., after "The cat sat", what comes next?)
  
  Larger window sizes generally produce more coherent text because they capture more context, but they require more training data to work well.
  
  ## Building a Markov Dictionary
  
  To implement a Markov chain, we create a "dictionary" that maps sequences of words (keys) to possible next words and their frequencies (values).
  
  In the next section, we'll examine how this works in code.
