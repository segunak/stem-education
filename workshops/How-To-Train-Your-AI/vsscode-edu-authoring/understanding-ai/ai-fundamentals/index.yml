      # How AI Actually Works: Guess, Check, Adjust

      Modern AI like ChatGPT might seem magical, but it's really just **patterns, math, and lots of practice**. AI functions by analyzing data, detecting patterns, making educated guesses, and improving through feedback.

      ## The Core Process: Guess, Check, Adjust

      At its heart, all AI follows this simple cycle:
      1. **Guess**: Make a prediction based on patterns in the data
      2. **Check**: Compare the prediction to the correct answer
      3. **Adjust**: Tweak internal parameters to get closer to the right answer next time

      This process happens millions or billions of times during training!

      ## Key Concepts You'll Apply Today

      * **Context Window**: Looking at previous words to predict the next one
      * **Temperature**: Controlling how "creative" vs. "predictable" the AI is
      * **Training**: The process of improving predictions through repetition

      In the next unit, you'll build your own simple AI text generator and see these concepts in action!
