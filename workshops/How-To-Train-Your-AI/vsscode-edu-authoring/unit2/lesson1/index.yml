title: "Markov Chain Text Generation"
description: >
  This lesson explores how adding context through Markov chains significantly improves text generation.
  You'll experiment with window size and temperature parameters to see how they affect the
  coherence and creativity of the generated text.
objectives: |-
  - Understand how Markov chains use previous words to predict the next one
  - Learn how window size affects the amount of context considered
  - Discover how temperature controls creativity vs. predictability
  - Generate more coherent text by tuning these parameters
