title: "Training Your AI: Finding the Perfect Settings"
level: beginner
description: >-
  In this exercise, you'll experience what it's like to be an AI trainer,
  working with a text generation model similar to how ChatGPT started learning -
  through next-word prediction.

  Your mission: Adjust the model parameters to transform random nonsense into
  coherent, readable text!
objectives: >-
  By the end of this exercise, you'll be able to:

  🧠 Understand how AI text generation models use parameters to produce coherent
  text

  🔍 Explain the role of context window in improving text coherence

  🌡️ Demonstrate how temperature affects creativity vs predictability in AI
  outputs

  🛠️ Debug common issues in AI text generation by adjusting parameters

  🔄 Experience the iterative process of AI model tuning that real Machine
  Learning engineers use

  ⚖️ Compare outputs from different parameter combinations to find optimal
  settings
prerequisites: >-
  No coding experience required! This activity is designed for beginners.
  Students should:

  🖱️ Have basic computer skills (mouse, keyboard, web browser)

  🤔 Be familiar with the concept that AI learns from examples (covered in the
  workshop introduction)
