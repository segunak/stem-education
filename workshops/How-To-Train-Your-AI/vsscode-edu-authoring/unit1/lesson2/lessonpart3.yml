  # The Temperature Parameter
  
  In addition to window size, another important parameter in text generation is "temperature." This controls how predictable or creative the model's word choices are.
  
  ## What is Temperature?
  
  Temperature is a parameter that affects the probability distribution when selecting the next word. It's named after the concept of temperature in physics, where higher temperatures mean more molecular movement and randomness.
  
  In text generation:
  
  - **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The model becomes more conservative and predictable, strongly favoring words with the highest probability
  - **High temperature** (e.g., 1.5): The model becomes more adventurous and creative, giving more consideration to less probable words
  
  ## How Temperature Works
  
  When choosing the next word, we adjust the probabilities based on temperature:
  
  1. With **low temperature**, high-probability words become even more likely, and low-probability words become even less likely
  2. With **high temperature**, probabilities become more uniform, giving lower-probability words a better chance
  
  Finding the right temperature is important:
  
  - Too low → repetitive, predictable text
  - Too high → chaotic, nonsensical text
  - Just right → coherent yet interesting text
  
  In the next section, you'll experiment with different window sizes and temperatures to see how they affect the generated text.
