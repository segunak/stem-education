  # Combining All AI Training Concepts
  
  In the previous lessons, you learned about:
  
  1. **Random text generation** - Picking words without any intelligence
  2. **Markov chains** - Using context (window size) to improve prediction
  3. **Temperature** - Controlling creativity vs. predictability
  
  Now we'll combine all these concepts into an interactive system where you have full control over the text generation process.
  
  ## Interactive Text Generation
  
  In this lesson, you'll work with a more advanced version of our text generation system that adds:
  
  - **Starting Word Selection**: Choose the first word to guide the text
  - **Output Length Control**: Decide how many words to generate
  - **Parameter Adjustment**: Fine-tune window size and temperature
  
  This interactive approach demonstrates how AI engineers adjust parameters to achieve desired results. It's similar to how real AI systems are tuned, just at a much smaller scale.
  
  ## The Interactive Experience
  
  The interactive system will:
  
  1. Ask you how many words to generate
  2. Ask you for the window size and temperature values
  3. Let you choose a starting word
  4. Generate text based on your settings
  
  By experimenting with different combinations, you'll discover how each parameter influences the output and develop an intuition for AI text generation.
