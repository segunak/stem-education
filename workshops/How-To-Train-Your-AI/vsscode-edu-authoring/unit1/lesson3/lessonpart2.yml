  # Starting Words and Their Impact
  
  One powerful feature of our interactive AI model is the ability to select a starting word. This gives you more control over the generated text's theme and direction.
  
  ## How Starting Words Work
  
  In our previous models, we randomly selected a starting sequence. With the interactive model, you can choose the first word, and the model will:
  
  1. Begin with your chosen word
  2. Use the Markov chain to predict following words based on your window size
  3. Continue generating text while applying your temperature setting
  
  ## The Power of Initial Conditions
  
  The starting word acts as a seed that influences the entire text. Different starting words can lead to completely different outputs, even with identical window size and temperature settings.
  
  This demonstrates an important concept in AI: **initial conditions matter**. Real AI systems are also sensitive to how they begin processing information.
  
  ## Good Starting Words
  
  Some words are better starting points than others:
  
  - **Common words** like "The", "I", or "On" often appear in many contexts in the training data, giving the model flexibility
  - **Specific words** that appear less frequently might lead to more focused or limited text
  - **Words that don't appear** in the training data will cause the model to select a random start
  
  In the next section, you'll get to experiment with different starting words along with other parameters.
