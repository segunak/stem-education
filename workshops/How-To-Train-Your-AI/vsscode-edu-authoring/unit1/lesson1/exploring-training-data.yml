  # Exploring the Training Data


  Before we can understand how AI learns, let's examine the data it learns from.
  AI models don't create information from nothing - they learn patterns from
  existing data.


  ## What is Training Data?


  Training data is the collection of examples that AI uses to learn patterns.
  For large language models like ChatGPT, this includes billions of sentences
  from books, articles, websites, and other text sources.


  For our simplified workshop, we're using a small dataset contained in the
  `data.txt` file. Let's take a look:


  ## Our Training Data


  Open the `data.txt` file in the file explorer to see the sentences our AI
  model will learn from. These sentences represent the entire universe of
  knowledge for our model - it can't know anything that isn't in this data.


  Notice that this is a very small dataset compared to real AI models, which
  might use trillions of words of training data. Our small dataset will limit
  what our model can do, but it's perfect for learning the core concepts.


  Take a moment to read through the sentences in `data.txt`. You'll be able to
  see how these sentences influence what our AI generates in the later
  exercises.
