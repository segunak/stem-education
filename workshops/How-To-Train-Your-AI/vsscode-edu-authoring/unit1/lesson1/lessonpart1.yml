  # Welcome to "How To Train Your AI"!

  In this workshop, you'll learn how AI models like ChatGPT are trained by building your own simple text prediction system step by step. By the end, you'll understand the fundamental concepts behind modern AI systems and have hands-on experience with training a basic model.

  ## What You'll Learn

  In this workshop, we'll explore:
  
  1. How computers generate text without any intelligence (pure randomness)
  2. How adding context improves prediction using Markov chains
  3. How parameters like "window size" and "temperature" affect AI output
  4. How to create your own interactive text generation system
  
  ## Workshop Structure

  We'll progress through three key lessons:
  
  1. **Random Text Generation**: Understanding the baseline (where we are now)
  2. **Adding Intelligence with Markov Chains**: Learning how context and parameters improve output
  3. **Interactive AI Control**: Taking full control of your model with parameters and starting words
  
  Throughout this workshop, you'll see the core "guess, check, adjust" cycle that forms the foundation of how real AI systems learn.

  Let's get started!
