  # Random Text Generation
  
  Let's start with the simplest approach to text generation: pure randomness. This establishes our baseline before adding any "intelligence."

  ## The Random Approach
  
  In this approach:
  1. We load words from our training data
  2. We pick words completely at random
  3. We put these words together to form a "sentence"
  
  This method doesn't consider context, meaning, or grammar - it's just random selection. It's like putting all the words in a hat and drawing them out blindfolded.
  
  ## Try It Yourself
  
  Look at the code in the editor. This simple program:
  - Loads the words from `data.txt`
  - Picks 10 random words
  - Prints them as output
  
  When you're ready, click the "Run" button in the REPL to see what random text looks like.
  
  ## Questions to Consider:
  
  After running the code:
  - Does the output make any sense?
  - Can you see any coherent phrases or patterns?
  - Why doesn't random selection produce meaningful text?
  
  This demonstrates why we need more sophisticated approaches to generate text that sounds like it was written by a human. In the next lesson, we'll start adding intelligence to our model.

  # 01_basic_predictor.py
  #
  # In this script, we pick words at random to form sentences, without any learning or context.
  # Instructions:
  # 1. Run this code by clicking the "Run" button.
  # 2. Observe the output in the terminal below.
  # 3. Notice that the output does not resemble your training text at allâ€”it's random.
  #
  # This shows you the starting point: pure randomness, no understanding.

  import os
  import random

  # Ensure the script always reads data.txt from the same directory as this script
  script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
  data_file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "data.txt")

  # Read the data
  with open(data_file_path, "r") as f:
      lines = f.readlines()

  # Split lines into words
  words = []
  for line in lines:
      words.extend(line.strip().split())

  # We just pick a sequence of random words, no context or learning.
  output_length = 10
  generated_words = [random.choice(words) for _ in range(output_length)]

  print("\n--- 01_basic_predictor.py ---")
  print("Randomly generated words (no context, no learning):\n")
  print("*" * 50)
  print(" ".join(generated_words))
  print("*" * 50)
  print("\nDoes the sentence above make any sort of sense? Take a look at data.txt to see the training data!")
