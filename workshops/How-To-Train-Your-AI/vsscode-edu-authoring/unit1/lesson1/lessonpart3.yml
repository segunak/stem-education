  # Random Text Generator

  **Your Task:** Run the code below to see what random text generation looks like.

  ## Steps:
  1. Click the **Run** button in the REPL panel
  2. Look at the output - it's completely random!
  3. Open `data.txt` in the file explorer to see where these words came from

  ## Key Point:
  This shows the baseline before any AI learning. The words are chosen randomly with no context or pattern.

  # Random Text Generator
  # This picks words completely at random with no learning or context.

  import os
  import random

  # Load training data
  script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
  data_file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "../../data.txt")

  with open(data_file_path, "r") as f:
      lines = f.readlines()

  # Split lines into words
  words = []
  for line in lines:
      words.extend(line.strip().split())

  # Generate 10 random words
  output_length = 10
  generated_words = [random.choice(words) for _ in range(output_length)]

  print("\n=== RANDOM TEXT GENERATION ===")
  print("Words chosen completely at random with no intelligence:\n")
  print("*" * 50)
  print(" ".join(generated_words))
  print("*" * 50)
  print("\nDoes this make any sense? Notice how there's no pattern or coherence.")
  print("This is our starting point before adding any intelligence.")
