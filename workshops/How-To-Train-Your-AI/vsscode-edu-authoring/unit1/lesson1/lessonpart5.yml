title: Creating code files
duration: 5
content: >
  Want to include your own code  files in the lesson? The File Explorer located
  in the bottom left corner is here to help. You can either **drag and drop**
  them directly into the File Explorer or select the **(+) icon** to create a
  new file.&#x20;


  When creating a file:


  1. At the top of the screen, **enter a name for the file** (e.g., `script.py`,
  `index.html`, `main.js`) so it has a proper extension.

  2. **Show the Code Editor** (in Lesson Page Settings) if you want students to
  open and modify the file directly.


  By adjusting these settings, you control whether learners will have access to
  review and interact with your code file hands‐on.&#x20;

  Experiment with creating files and adjusting the settings - your changes are
  immediate, so you can see how each option affects the learning experience.
