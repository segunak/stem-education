  Each lesson page can be tailored to fit your teaching goals. Whether you want
  to provide a read‐only reference or an interactive coding environment, these
  options help you decide how students will engage with your material. Using the
  "Lesson Page Settings" tab, you can set:

   * **Title**: change how this page is labeled in your lesson.

   * **Duration (in minutes)**: let learners know how much time they might spend
   on the page.

   * **Show Content**: toggle whether the page’s text is displayed.

   * **Show Terminal**: turn on the built‐in terminal so students can run commands
   or code from the Editor.

   * **Show Editor**: allow learners to directly edit a code file you provide.

   * **Show Explorer**: give learners access to the file explorer to view and
   manage lesson files you provide.


   Feel free to experiment with these settings - your changes are immediate, so
   you can see how each option affects the learning experience.
