  # Exploring the Training Data

  Before we can understand how AI learns, let's examine the data it learns from. AI models don't create information from nothing - they learn patterns from existing data.
  
  ## What is Training Data?
  
  Training data is the collection of examples that AI uses to learn patterns. For large language models like ChatGPT, this includes billions of sentences from books, articles, websites, and other text sources.
  
  For our simplified workshop, we're using a small dataset contained in the `data.txt` file. Let's take a look:

  ## Our Training Data

  Open the `data.txt` file in the file explorer to see the sentences our AI model will learn from. These sentences represent the entire universe of knowledge for our model - it can't know anything that isn't in this data.

  Notice that this is a very small dataset compared to real AI models, which might use trillions of words of training data. Our small dataset will limit what our model can do, but it's perfect for learning the core concepts.

  Take a moment to read through the sentences in `data.txt`. You'll be able to see how these sentences influence what our AI generates in the later exercises.

  # Random Text Generator

  **Your Task:** Run the code below to see what random text generation looks like.

  ## Steps:
  1. Click the **Run** button in the REPL panel
  2. Look at the output - it's completely random!
  3. Open `data.txt` in the file explorer to see where these words came from

  ## Key Point:
  This shows the baseline before any AI learning. The words are chosen randomly with no context or pattern.

code: |
  # Random Text Generator
  # This picks words completely at random with no learning or context.

  import os
  import random

  # Load training data
  script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
  data_file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "../../data.txt")

  with open(data_file_path, "r") as f:
      lines = f.readlines()

  # Split lines into words
  words = []
  for line in lines:
      words.extend(line.strip().split())

  # Generate 10 random words
  output_length = 10
  generated_words = [random.choice(words) for _ in range(output_length)]

  print("\n=== RANDOM TEXT GENERATION ===")
  print("Words chosen completely at random with no intelligence:\n")
  print("*" * 50)
  print(" ".join(generated_words))
  print("*" * 50)
  print("\nDoes this make any sense? Notice how there's no pattern or coherence.")
  print("This is our starting point before adding any intelligence.")
