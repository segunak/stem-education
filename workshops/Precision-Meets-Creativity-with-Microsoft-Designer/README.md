# Precision Meets Creativity with Microsoft Designer

Welcome to the "Precision Meets Creativity with Microsoft Designer" workshop! This workshop is designed to help students explore the power of AI and creativity by generating custom images using Microsoft Designer.

## Introduction

In this workshop, students will learn how to use Microsoft Designer to create AI-generated images. By filling in the blanks with their own adjectives and descriptive words, students can customize the images to make them unique. This hands-on activity encourages creativity and collaboration among students.

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into five main prompts, each with a specific theme, plus bonus prompts for additional creative options. Students will follow the instructions provided in the [index.html](workshops/Precision-Meets-Creativity-with-Microsoft-Designer/index.html) file to generate images based on the prompts. The steps are as follows:

1. Scroll down or use the sidebar menu to find the first prompt.
2. Click the **"Generate Image"** button to open **Microsoft Designer**.
3. Fill in the blanks with your own adjectives or descriptive words to customize the AI-generated image. **Do not leave the default words in place**, replace them with your own words to make your image unique!
4. Each student should contribute a word to the blanks, taking turns until all are filled, then generate the image.
5. Once the image is generated, discuss the results and make small changes to see how they affect the output.
6. Repeat the process for each prompt until all five are completed.
7. For additional creative options, explore the bonus prompts.
