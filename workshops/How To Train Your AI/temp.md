## TO DO (Pending Decisions & Finalizations)

1. **PowerPoint Content & Flow:**  
   - Finalize the sequence of slides and talking points for the presentation portion.
   - Decide how much emphasis to place on image-based recognition examples vs. text-based examples. (Current inclination: briefly mention image-based concepts, then focus on text-based LLM explanation.)
   - Confirm whether to integrate the cat image recognition activity fully or to reference it briefly and move on to text-based models.

2. **Coding Activity Details (Visual Studio Code for Education):**  
   - Determine the exact coding exercise. Options include:  
     - A simplified Markov chain text generator that shows how probability tables work.  
     - A very small “training” simulation where students adjust code or parameters to improve the model's guesses.
   - Decide if you can incorporate an external API (OpenAI or Hugging Face) without overwhelming students.
   - Create a step-by-step guide for students within VS Code (e.g., starter code and instructions).

3. **Choosing the Example Text and Context Window:**  
   - Decide on a simple dataset or text snippet to demonstrate how next-word prediction works in code.
   - Determine if you will show students a frequency table or just have them run code that produces a simple output.

4. **Final Definitions and Jargon Simplification:**  
   - Finalize simple, student-friendly definitions for Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning.
   - Ensure consistency and clarity when using terms like "weights," "fine-tuning," and "stochastic."

5. **Time Management:**
   - Confirm how to split the 1-hour session:  
     - Proposed: 30 minutes lecture (with PowerPoint and pen-and-paper activity) and ~30 minutes coding.
   - Adjust if needed.

6. **Pen-and-Paper Activity Details:**
   - Finalize instructions for the “fill in the blank” and “cat vs. not cat” pen-and-paper exercises.
   - Decide if the foreign/gibberish language demonstration will be a brief classroom activity or tied directly to the coding segment.

## Workshop Overview

**Title:** How To Train Your AI—Demystifying ChatGPT With Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning Basics

**Duration:** ~1 hour (approx. 30 min presentation & discussion, 30 min coding activity)

**Audience:** High school students with little to no technical background in AI or coding.

**Goal:**  
By the end of this workshop, students should have a fundamental understanding of what AI and ChatGPT are doing under the hood, how Machine Learning (ML), Neural Networks (NNs), and Deep Learning (DL) fit together, and experience a hands-on coding activity to reinforce these concepts in a simplified form.

## Introduction

Modern AI, like ChatGPT, seems magical, but it's really about patterns, math, and massive amounts of practice. Unlike Hollywood robots, AI doesn't have feelings or self-awareness. It can't “understand” the way humans do. Instead, it looks for patterns in data, guesses answers, and then improves those guesses based on feedback—over and over again until it appears impressively intelligent.

**Key Idea:** Machine Learning is a giant guess-and-check process. The AI tries something, sees if it's right, and adjusts. Repeat this millions or billions of times, and you get results that seem like true understanding but are really just well-tuned patterns.

## Types of AI Training

### Supervised Learning (Example: Images)

- **Scenario:** Teaching a model to recognize if an image contains a cat.
- **Process:**  
  1. Show the model many labeled examples ("cat," "not cat").  
  2. The model guesses whether a new image is a cat.  
  3. Compare the guess to the correct label and adjust the internal “weights.”  
  4. Repeat thousands or millions of times.
  
- **Outcome:** Eventually, the model gets very good at recognizing cats. This is supervised learning because we provide the correct answers (labels).

### Self-Supervised Learning (Text and ChatGPT)

- **Scenario:** Large Language Models like ChatGPT don't get explicit labels for each word. Instead, they try to predict the next word in a sentence.
- **Process:**  
  1. The AI reads tons of text (books, articles, websites).  
  2. Given a sequence of words, it guesses the next word.  
  3. Check against the actual next word in the original text.  
  4. If wrong, adjust weights; if right, reinforce the current approach.
  
- **Outcome:** Over trillions of guesses, the model learns grammar, common phrases, and context. It becomes very good at producing sentences that sound human.

**Note:** The model isn't understanding meaning—it's just playing a massive “fill-in-the-blank” game at a superhuman scale.

## Linking Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning

- **Machine Learning (ML):** The broad field of teaching computers to learn from examples rather than explicit instructions.  
- **Neural Networks (NNs):** A specific technique in ML inspired by the human brain. Networks consist of layers of “neurons,” each focusing on different aspects of the data. Over many examples, they adjust their internal weights to improve.  
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses many layers (hence “deep”) of neural networks. This allows models to learn very complex patterns, like understanding language context in ChatGPT.

**In Short:**
- ML: The overall guess-and-check learning approach.
- NNs: The layered structure used to process inputs and learn patterns.
- DL: NNs but with many layers, enabling the model to learn very intricate patterns.

## Understanding ChatGPT Through Simple Concepts

### Markov Chains and Frequency Tables

Early attempts to generate text used frequency tables (like Markov chains) to guess the next word. However, these methods struggled with long context and complexity.

- **Markov Chains:**  
  - Look at one or two previous words and guess the next word based on frequency.
  - Works somewhat but results are often nonsense because it can't handle long-range context or deep meaning.

### Transition to Deep Learning

Instead of manually building huge frequency tables, deep learning lets the model learn its own patterns for predicting the next word. By training on vast text corpora, the model figures out which words often follow others without us telling it the rules.

**Stochastic:**  
The word means “randomly determined.” Language models introduce randomness to avoid repeating the same predictable answer and to sound more natural. This is why sometimes responses vary.

---

## Fine-Tuning and Human-in-the-Loop

After the model learns to predict words well, humans come in to help it be more helpful and less nonsensical. Human testers give feedback on the model's answers, and the model adjusts again. This process, called **fine-tuning**, improves the quality of interactions, making the AI more polite, helpful, and context-aware.

## Workshop Activities

### Activity 1 (In-Class, Pen-and-Paper or Slide Interaction)

**Guessing the Next Word:**
- Show a phrase: "to be or not to ____"
  - Students guess "be."
- Show another: "rock and ____"
  - Students guess "roll."
- Show a less obvious sentence where context matters.
  
Discuss how students are predicting words based on experience, just like how AI models predict based on massive training examples.

**Image Recognition Demo (Optional):**
- Show unfamiliar images and ask students to guess what they are. Then reveal the answers later. They see how their guesses improve after knowing some correct answers. This parallels the guess-adjust cycle in AI.

### Activity 2 (PowerPoint Simulation of Training)

**Simulated Neural Network Training:**
- Present a scenario where students play roles as neurons (like the cat example).  
- They guess “cat” or “not cat” and get feedback (you say "correct" or "incorrect").  
- After several rounds, they adjust their “weights” (i.e., rely more on certain clues).

**Language Prediction Simulation:**
- Show a simple dataset of text.
- Highlight how building a giant frequency table by hand is impossible.
- Introduce the idea of letting the computer figure it out by trial and error (deep learning).

### Activity 3 (Coding with VS Code for Education)

**Proposed Coding Exercise (Exact Details TBD):**
- Students open a pre-set coding environment with a basic script that:  
  - Loads a tiny dataset of text (could be a simple story or a small corpus of sentences).
  - Attempts to guess the next word. Initially, it's random and bad.
  - Students modify a parameter or run a "training" function that simulates adjusting weights based on correct/incorrect guesses.
  - Over multiple runs, they see improvement in how the code predicts words.

**Markov/NN Hybrid Simplification (TBD):**
- Show how starting from a simple “count what words follow which” approach leads to poor results.
- Introduce a “layer” of code that tries to weigh different inputs differently, simulating a simple neural network concept.
- If time allows and not too complex, mention how randomness (stochastic) can affect the output.

## Practical Notes and Advice for Students

- **AI Is Math, Not Magic:** It's about probabilities and patterns, not understanding or emotions.
- **Speed and Scale:** Big companies use massive data and powerful GPUs to do trillions of these guess-and-check operations.
- **No True Understanding:** The model doesn't know what words mean; it just knows how they tend to appear together.
- **Human Feedback Matters:** Fine-tuning with human input makes the model more useful and less confusing.

---

## After the Workshop

- Students leave with a basic understanding of how ChatGPT-like AI works:  
  - It predicts words based on patterns learned from huge text datasets.
  - It uses deep learning to handle complex patterns rather than building simple frequency tables manually.
- Provide optional resources for further learning.

## Summary

This workshop aims to strip away the intimidation factor of AI and show that at its core, AI is a well-trained guesser. By exploring Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and ChatGPT's text-prediction strategies, students see how patterns, feedback, and massive computation come together to produce what appears to be intelligent behavior.
