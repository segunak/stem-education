The cat sat on the mat
The dog barked at the cat
The cat chased a mouse
A cat and a dog can be friends
On the mat sat a quiet cat
Rock and roll
Let's get ready to rumble
Very mindful, very demure
Started from the bottom now we here
May the force be with you
That's what she said
To infinity and beyond
With great power comes great responsibility
It's about drive, it's about power
One does not simply walk into Mordor
Bond, James Bond
I've got so much rizz dude
No cap that Chipotle was fire
A Lannister always pays his debts
Actions speak louder than words
The pen is mightier than the sword
You reap what you sow
Out of the frying pan, into the fire
What we do in life, echoes in eternity
May thy knife chip and shatter
On Wednesdays we wear pink
Everyday I'm hustlin
Are you not entertained?
Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get
I'll be back
You can't handle the truth
I am Iron Man
Avengers, assemble
Fear is the mind-killer
Do or do not, there is no try
Why so serious?
I solemnly swear I am up to no good
Winter is coming
You're a wizard, Harry
Live long and prosper
This is Sparta!
It's over 9000!
I am vengeance, I am the night, I am Batman
Do you feel lucky, punk?
I'll have what she's having
My mama always said stupid is as stupid does
She doesn't even go here
I volunteer as tribute
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer
Say hello to my little friend
Hasta la vista, baby
Run, Forrest, run
Being broke does something to your spirit
Why did the chicken cross the road?
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
If you build it, they will come
Elementary, my dear Watson
King Kong ain't got nothing on me
I'm leaving here with something
You pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too. That's a part of it
Man gives you the award, but God gives you the reward
Don't aspire to make a living. Aspire to make a difference
This ain't chess, it ain't checkers either
If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you do, you're misinformed
I guarantee it
What we do in life echoes in eternity
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn
Here's looking at you, kid
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse
Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore
I see dead people
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer
Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys
Houston, we have a problem
You're gonna need a bigger boat
I'm walking here! I'm walking here!
You're tearing me apart, Lisa!
Hasta la vista, baby
I'll have what she's having
Show me the money!
You had me at hello
To infinity and beyond!
Elementary, my dear Watson
May the odds be ever in your favor
Why so serious?
I am Groot
You shall not pass!
