The cat sat on the mat
The dog barked at the cat
The cat chased a mouse
A cat and a dog can be friends
On the mat sat a quiet cat
Rock and roll
Let's get ready to rumble
Very mindful, very demure
Started from the bottom now we here
May the force be with you
That's what she said
To infinity and beyond
With great power comes great responsibility
It's about drive, it's about power
One does not simply walk into Mordor
Bond, James Bond
A Lannister always pays his debts
Actions speak louder than words
The pen is mightier than the sword
You reap what you sow
Out of the frying pan, into the fire
What we do in life, echoes in eternity
May thy knife chip and shatter
