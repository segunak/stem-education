# 01_basic_predictor.py
#
# In this script, we pick words at random to form sentences, without any learning or context.
# Instructions:
# 1. Run this code by clicking the "Run" button.
# 2. Observe the output in the terminal below.
# 3. Notice that the output does not resemble your training text at allâ€”it's random.
#
# After this, you'll move on to the next file (02_markov_improved.py) where we start adding some intelligence,
# such as considering previous words (Markov chains) and probability weighting.
#
# The goal of this file is to show you the starting point: pure randomness, no understanding.
