# Guess, Check, Adjust: Training AI One Step at a Time

This project contains four Python files that you will run in sequence. Each file demonstrates a step towards making a simple text-prediction model more coherent and intelligent.

## Instructions

1. Start with `01_basic_predictor.py`: Run it as is and see the random output.
2. Move to `02_markov_window.py`: Adjust `window_size` to see the effect of considering more context.
3. In `03_tweak_probability.py`: Tweak parameters like `temperature` to improve text quality.
4. Finally, `04_interactive.py`: Interact with your mini model, giving it a starting word and seeing how it continues the sentence.

## Data

`data.txt` contains the small dataset of sentences from which the model learns word transitions.

Follow the instructions in each file's comments closely.
