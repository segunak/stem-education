# 02_markov_window.py
#
# In this script, we improve text generation by looking at the sequence of previous words.
# This approach is often called a "Markov Chain." Don't worry about the nameâ€”it just means:
# "Look at the last few words to guess what comes next."
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Run the script and follow the prompts in the console.
# 2. You can stick with the defaults for `window_size` and `output_length` or enter your own values.
# 3. Observe how the generated text changes as you adjust these values.
# 4. If you're not sure, start with the defaults and experiment later!
#
# Note: If `window_size` is too large (e.g., larger than the number of words in the training data or `output_length`),
# the program will guide you to choose better values.
#
# After experimenting, move on to the next file.
